# Membership Type Analysis for cyclistic-divvy-bikes

This case study is based on the capstone project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

The six phases of analysis were implemented as follows:

1.**Ask**:  
The problem statement was analysed and the following objectives were inferred:
*Analysing difference between casual riders and annual members.
*Deriving insights that can point us in the direction to convert casual riders into annual members.

2. **Prepare**:  
The data was acquired from the Divvy Bikes website: https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data
The data for the year 2016 was located in spreadsheets in year wise folders.
For this analysis we have considered the data from year 2016. There were 6 csv files, 3 for quarter 1, 3 and 4, and 3 for month 4, 5 and 6.

3. Process:
The data for the entire year was combined in one dataframe. Any new column ride_length was added for ease of analysis. The entire data cleaning process is highlighted in the R markdown file (Cleaning_Using_R.rmd).

4. Analyse:
SQL queries were used to analyse the dataset. Various trends were uncovered during the analysis process. The queries used for analysis are highlighted in the file Analysis_using_queries.sql.

5. Share:
The insights derived from the analyse phase were visualised using Tableau. The link to the visualisations:
